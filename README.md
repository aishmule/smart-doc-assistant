# 🧠 Smart Doc Assistant – AI-Powered Document Workflow Agent

**Smart Doc Assistant** is a prototype AI agent designed to enhance productivity within Google Workspace by analyzing documents, extracting key action items, and automating next steps like email drafting or calendar scheduling.

⚡ Built with React + Flask and powered by GPT-4 (or Gemini API), this assistant demonstrates the potential of agent-based AI workflows, inspired by Google’s "Workspace Flows" and “Gems”.
